# connector-ldap
Polygon/ConnId LDAP Connector based on ApacheDS client SDK


Fork Branch from Evolveum Open Source Connector-LDAP version 3.7 on 11/2024

https://github.com/ExclamationLabs/connector-ldap forked from https://github.com/Evolveum/connector-ldap tag v3.7

Naming of the new JAR should now have a elabs prefix to distinguish it from Evolvuem's
Example: elabs-connector-ldap-3.7.jar

Merging of the branch should not go to Master/Main - instead merge to 3.7 branch (or current matched Evolveum version).

CI/CD pipeline will be manual for now.

This connector is deployed through the Connector-Server to Midpoint environments.  References are also in the Storage API project.
